# House Baby Chess Rules
1. Ok, so set up a regular chess board.

2. Obtain a Monopoly house. Black places this on any empty square before the game starts. It may not be taken.
It may be moved in leu of any move that you could make, except when the king is in check. It moves to any of the 8
adjacent squares that have no pieces on them.

3. Each player must obtain a baby piece. Logo figures for example. White places first, followed by black on an empty
square before the game starts. It must be a square adjacent to one of your own pieces at all times. This is called
looking after the baby. The baby may not be taken by an opponent's pieces, or your own for that matter.

4. If the baby is moved, it is to one of the adjacent 8 squares. The baby may capture an opponent's piecewhenn moving
by removing the opponent piece from the board from where the baby moved to. Remember you can't move the baby away from
a square adjacent to a piece of yours, to a square where no piece of yours is looking after the baby.

5. If your opponent captures the last piece looking after the baby, deserting the baby, unless you are in check you must
move a piece closer to the baby, although note it doesn't have to move adjacent to the baby immediatly. It can take
multiple moves.

6. The final baby feature is housing the baby, by a move which swaps house and baby when they are adjacent. This is treated
like one move even though 2 pieces move. The baby must in that case still be looked after, even if it is by a different piece.
You may not house the baby if it is not looked after by an adjacent piece.

7. And then you play, remembering only kights can jump over houses and babies, and neither houses nor babies can be captured.
If you are in stalemate, check to see if you can move the house or your baby. You can't desert your baby to escape stalemate.

8. The house consistency rule applies in relation to moving into check by the house. On your turn the house is "yours"
and so you could move next to it but have you moved into check? In this sense the house can't attack the king. The house
is therefore not active against the king.

Some say this changes the whole game of Chess. Just adding a house and two different coloured babies.
